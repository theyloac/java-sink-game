# Simple Startup Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Simple Startup Game! This is a basic Java-based game designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts in a fun and interactive way. The game revolves around guessing the correct sequence of numbers, simulating a simple hit-and-miss scenario.

## Game Description
In Simple Startup Game, the player is tasked with finding a 'startup' located at a series of consecutive numbers in a grid. The game randomly selects a starting position and the player must guess the sequence. Each guess results in a 'hit', 'miss', or 'kill' response, guiding the player towards the solution.

## Educational Purpose
This game is created as a learning tool for students and beginners in Java programming. It demonstrates key concepts such as:
- Basic Java syntax and structure.
- Use of conditional statements and loops.
- Implementation of arrays.
- Object-oriented programming principles.
- User input handling with `Scanner`.
- Basic game logic development.

## How to Play
- The game randomly selects a location (a set of three consecutive numbers) on a grid.
- Players enter their guesses for the grid location.
- The game responds with 'hit' if the guess is correct, 'miss' if incorrect, and 'kill' if all locations are hit.
- The aim is to 'kill' the startup with the fewest number of guesses.

## How to Run
To run the game, you need to have Java installed on your machine. Clone the repository, compile the Java files, and run `SimpleStartupGame` as the main class.
